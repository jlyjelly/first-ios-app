## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Messenger

An app I would like to build is a wikipedia for slime lovers where users are able 
to browse different textures of slime. Within each category, there are recipes
that users can use to create their slime. There could also be a forum where
people are able to discuss their slime or post them and give eachother feedback.
Also, I would like to have a page where people can see slime shop reviews and 
recommend slime shops. It would be something like a Reddit community / Wikipedia for slime.

## Notes

I had trouble finding out what the StoryBoard file was for the longest time until I realized it meant the main file. It also took some time for me to sync my files to github since I realized I made another account previously. Another thing I was not sure about was how to center my button. It seemed I had to move it more towards the right to make it appear "aligned" in the middle.
